Nuclei is a fast, open-source, and highly customizable vulnerability scanner that uses simple YAML-based templates to automate security scanning across different protocols. It is widely used by security professionals to detect vulnerabilities efficiently and accurately with community-contributed templates and integration-friendly architecture.

## Key Features of Nuclei

- Customizable YAML-based templates for defining vulnerability detection rules
- High-speed scanning engine written in Go for efficiency and scalability
- Supports multiple protocols: HTTP, DNS, TCP, SSL, WHOIS, file, headless browser, and more
- Large repository of community-contributed templates covering various vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Easy integration with CI/CD pipelines and other reconnaissance tools.
- Supports automation, workflows, filtering by severity, tags, and custom scanning profiles.

## Components

- **Nuclei Engine**: Core scanning engine handling target requests and matching responses against templates.
- **Nuclei Templates**: YAML files defining detection logic for specific vulnerabilities or security issues.

## Installation and Update Instructions for Nuclei

- Install Nuclei via Go:
    
    ```bash
    go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
    
    ```
    
- Then copy the binary to your local bin directory:
    
    ```bash
    cp ~/go/bin/nuclei /usr/local/bin/nuclei
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/nuclei
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    ls -lh /usr/local/bin/nuclei
    
    ```
    
- (Note: Adjust the path ~/go/bin/nuclei if your Go bin directory is somewhere else.)
- Update Nuclei Engine:
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -update-engine
    
    ```
    
- or (if you want the shortcut command)
    
    ```bash
    nuclei-up
    
    ```
    
- Update Nuclei Templates:
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -update-templates
    
    ```
    
- or shorthand:
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -ut
    
    ```
    
- Summary of common update commands:
    - Update engine: nuclei-up
    - Update templates: nuclei -ut

## Basic Usage Examples

- Scan a single target (can be a website or IP address):
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <https://example.com>
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <http://192.168.1.235>
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <http://192.168.1.150>
    
    ```
    
- Scan multiple targets from a file (targets.txt contains one URL/IP per line):
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -l targets.txt
    
    ```
    
- Use Naabu to scan ports silently for multiple hosts, then pass results to Nuclei to scan for vulnerabilities:
    
    ```bash
    naabu -silent -p -host 192.168.1.150,192.168.1.235 -o naabu-output.log
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -l naabu-output.log -o nuclei-output.log
    
    ```
    
- Scan a target using specific template directories (e.g., templates for exposed admin panels):
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <https://example.com> -t /root/nuclei-templates/http/exposed-panels/
    
    ```
    
- Save scan output results to a file:
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <https://example.com> -o nuclei-output.log
    
    ```
    

## Advanced Usage

- Use tags to filter templates by severity or category:
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <https://example.com> -s high,critical
    
    ```
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -target <https://example.com> -tags cves,dns
    
    ```
    
- Run workflows for complex scanning scenarios:
    
    ```bash
    nuclei -l targets.txt -workflows /root/nuclei-templates/workflows/default-application-workflow.yaml
    
    ```
    
- Pipe port scan results (using Naabu) directly into Nuclei for vulnerability scanning:
    
    ```bash
    naabu -p -host 192.168.1.51 -silent | nuclei
    
    ```
